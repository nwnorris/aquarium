A puzzle's JSON should contain the following top-level items:
  - size
    [The grid dimensions of the puzzle]
    x: Number
    y: Number
  - blocks
    [List of blocks and the squares that make them up]
    [
      [SID0, SID1, ..., SIDN],
      [SID0, SID1, ..., SIDN],
      ...,
      [SID0, SID1, ..., SIDN]
    ]

Puzzles should be validated on load.
A puzzle is valid if all square IDs are allocated to precisely one block, and all squares are adjacent to at least one other square in their block.
